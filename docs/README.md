This folder contains a collection of discussion threads from the Holy City Audio phpBB forum.

Some of these contained attachments and it's possible that those can be found in the patches folder one level up.  In early 2016 the site sustained an external hack, which required extensive recovery measures.  Unfortunately one casualty of this was that all attachments wound up getting corrupted.  So some of the attachments may be corrupted or simply not there, as I know that all of them prior to 2016 were destroyed.
