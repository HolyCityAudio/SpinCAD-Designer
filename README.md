SpinCAD-Designer
================

SpinCAD Designer is an open source Java project which allows creation and audio simulation of patches for the Spin FV-1 audio DSP chip.
It should be used with the Eclipse Java development package, or with the Eclipse DSL development package if you 
wish to explore SpinCAD-Builder.

If you simply want to use SpinCAD Designer, download the SpinCAD-whatever.jar file and run it on your computer.  You'll need JRE/JDK 1.8 or later.

Initially I developed SpinCAD Designer in Eclipse for Java, Juno and Kepler Versions.  Now, after transferring the code from an SVN account into Github, I have also moved to Eclipse Luna.  I think I'm using Mars now.  Time flies!  As of 2020 I am no longer actively developing SpinCAD Designer.

I use the Java and DSL (Doman Specific Language) version of the IDE.  SpinCAD Designer itself can be compiled strictly from the Java source supplied.
